## ***SUMMARY***

### Based on the presented information we can conclude that bike riding is a very interesting business to explore in Des Moines. If we follow a similar approach that the one used in New York City, we can expect a similar behaviour by having a base of suscribers that will tend to use the service on a continuous basis.

### It is recommended though, to perform two additional visualizations to appreciate more information in order to better support the decision:
### a) Trip count by Birth Day: This visualization will help us compare the use of the service based on the user age.
### b) User type by Birth Day: This visualization will help us know the age range of each type of user, this will allow us define a better marketing strategy for suscribers for instance.
